        <p>The <em>Penguins </em> is awesome because <strong> are a family of flightless seabirds. Where do penguins live? They live only in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of these birds are found in the coastal waters of Antarctica, and there are many of them in New Zealand, southern Australia, the coast of South America, and South Africa. The warmest place where these birds can live is the Galapagos Islands, the only penguin habitat region north of the equator.There are 18 species in this family.
