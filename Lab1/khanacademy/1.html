        My last summer
    </h1>
    
    <h4>
      
    <p>   Last summer was quiet and warm,<br>
Days felt simple, free from harm.<br>
I laughed with friends, I watched the sky,<br>
Time moved fast, I don’t know why.<br></p>


The sun was bright, the nights were long,<br>
Every moment felt like a song.<br>
Now it’s a memory, soft and true,<br>
Last summer — I still think of you.<br>
